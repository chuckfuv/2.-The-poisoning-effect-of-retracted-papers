Researchers in the medical field publish over 50,000 papers per year. PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) is a repository that keeps track of all these publications. Papers get retracted after being published. One main problem is that the results from these papers continue to be cited as valid even after being retracted. Retractions can happen due to minor errors that don't affect the credibility of the published work. For example, retractions due to: Figure/Chart/Image duplication, published somewhere else, change the license to the software described in the article making the software is no longer available, and irregularities in authorship during the submission process. However, some retractions happen due to serious misconduct that invalidates the results published in that work. For example, retractions due to: authors' plagiarism,  experiment mistake, falsified and/or fabricated data, and when the peer review process is compromised. For more details on retracted papers read: Grieneisen ML, Zhang M (2012) A Comprehensive Survey of Retracted Articles from the Scholarly Literature.

Various attempts have been carried out to flag all papers that should be retracted. However, it is usually done manually and cannot scale to cover the papers published every year. Retraction Watch (http://retractionwatch.com/) is one of the lead organizations working on cleaning the medical literature. Their manual efforts resulted in creating the Retraction Database (http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx) which currently flags 16,644 articles as retracted.

The objective of this project is to calculate a "poisoning" value for all papers on PubMed. A paper's "poisoning" value should reflect the agreement between that paper and the retracted/poisoned  papers it cites. The agreement here doesn't mean the papers use the same words but that they agree on the same conclusions.  Poisoned papers are those that are not retracted but highly similar yo retracted or other poisoned  papers they cite. The higher the "poisoning" value, the more probable the article becomes "retractable". You are free to calculate the "poisoning" value based on the paper Title, Abstract text, Conclusion text, or a combination of them.

A retracted paper is identified on PubMed with the [Publication Type] field set to “retracted publication”. On PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed), use the search keyword: ((("retracted publication"[Publication Type]))) to retrieve all retracted articles. PubMed also provide a set of APIs that you can use to retrieve the results pragmatically.
