# 2.-The-poisoning-effect-of-retracted-papers
Researchers in the medical field publish over 50,000 papers per year. PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) is a repository that keeps track of all these publications. Papers get retracted after being published. One main problem is that the results from these papers continue to be cited as valid even after being retracted. Retractions can happen due to minor errors that don't affect the credibility of the published work. For example, retractions due to: Figure/Chart/Image duplication, published somewhere else, change the license to the software described in the article making the software is no longer available, and irregularities in authorship during the submission process. However, some retractions happen due to serious misconduct that invalidates the results published in that work. For example, retractions due to: authors' plagiarism,  experiment mistake, falsified and/or fabricated data, and when the peer review process is compromised.
